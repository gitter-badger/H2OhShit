9.03,76.63,4,I can proudly say am from Kollam and the queen of lakes is in my district Sasthamkotta is a well known fresh water lake Its around 30km from Kollam city There is nothing special out there but the walk on shores feels good When we talk to the old locals we will get the clear picture of the lake in old days i can sadly say the lake is dying There is no conservation measures from the officials I visited there 2 times with my friends First visit i enjoyed lot and the second time it hurt me lot i can see dry lands where i sit and do fishing on my first visit Really want the officials to preserve this good Backwater The wast lake is good for boating Locals are good to interact Its a good place for a casual visit Lots of tourism possibilities are there Be careful on walking through shores in some places its muddy and shallow we get trapped %%#%%Nothing much to do except for just walking around Suggest carry items for picnic as there are no good eateries around Interacted witha lot of locals who said that the lake is shrinking due to faulty conservation policies The cliffs on the side of the lake are protected with coir netting which looked visually different and nice %%#%%My visit to lake was with my friends I heard a lot about this lake and wanted to visit But speaking I hated to see how the lake is dying vehicle washing encroaching %%#%%A must go the clean water lake rich greenery surrounded very nice place there are good hotels and resorts available a must visit in Kerala%%#%%It was a good experience to see the keralas only one fresh water lake It is very to see the temple near by the lake the famous Aiyyappa temple where the monkey feeding is occurred %%#%%
8.900888,76.568695,4,We visited this restaurant during our stay in Kollam It is a part of Hotel Raviz The plce is nice We ordered a la carte I was a little disappointed to see limited variety for vegetarian food in a la carte though buffet had good variety We ordered Italian and Chinese The service was a little slow but i was amazed by their hospitality While we were waiting for our order the waiter Sabin gave us complimentry testing of select buffet items That was something unexpected and speaks a lot about their efforts in achieving customer satisfaction The food we ordered was decent but the hospitality was something that made it a great experience %%#%%A decent Sit down restaurant is a rarity these days in Kollam Therefore when it was time for a family dinner I chose The Riverside About the experience going by various key aspects 1 Location Close enough to the town yet distant Decent parking options Approach road is a bit too narrow though Full marks here 2 Ambience While the restaurant decor is not that great the hotel and it s grounds are very beautiful Also the seats on the terrace provide a great view particularly on moon lit nights 3 Service This is the sore point Average service at best I was not able to get a recommendation even from the Waiter Service during the meal was also not up to the mark 4 Food The Menu had a wide range Tried quite a few dishes and liked all of them However none of the dishes felt remarkable A case of being good but not great Despite the overall average ratings I recommend the Riverside because of the beautiful setting overlooking the Ashtamudi Lake and the traditionally themed gardens This makes it a great place for a family outing on cool evenings if you end up going to the Riverside I strongly recommend a long walk around the hotel as the food gets prepared It will be quite an experience particularly on a bright moonlit night %%#%%Its in the WelcomHotel Raviz Happened to eat there as I was staying Food is good with lot of variety Most likely the best restaurant in Kollam %%#%%We stayed at the hotel and were able to enjoy a fantastic Chinese Thai lunch Italian Indian fusion dinner and a good spread continental breakfast buffet The team was able to customize the food to suit our taste buds and the service was impeccable Would highly recommend dining at this restaurant %%#%%Grilled Butter Lemon Fish is mouth watering as also Prawns Kandhari Vegetable Stew is also good and for Non Vegetarians Fish Moily and Mutton Seekh Kabab are also very tasty%%#%%

9.282594,79.31079,3,I did the booking for 6 rooms in the month of October 2014 I gave them clear instructions to arrange for Wheelchair and rooms on first floor only as my Grandparents were travelling for pilgrimage along with their friends At the time of arrival on 12th November 2014 they provided rooms on third floor and of substandard quality Disciplinary action needs to be taken against the booking staff Vinayaga Rameshwaram Terrible experience and dont even book for free %%#%%We had booked the room the day before and as we were arriving into Rameshwaram early morning we really needed a room ready As we got into the hotel the staff person there said that he couldnt find the room booking slip and therefore he couldnt give us the room at the price we had negotiated but he would give us another room at a higher price rate What irked me more than anything is the take it or leave it attitude and being told that it was my fault and that I should have booked the room online because everybody has a smartphone I don t think it was his job to determine as to how I should book rooms and I think it is unforgivable on their part Once the staff changed the lady that we originally dealt with did indeed confirm that she handled the booking and we got the original rate we negotiated for but after 3 hours of arguing waiting in the lobby horrible attitude and a bad experience %%#%%Overall it was a good experience to stay in this hotel Surprised by the maintenance but the staff and food at the restaurant are too bad Otherwise it would had been excellentThe staff at the restaurant needs to be more courteous %%#%%We stayed in Room No 105 at the hotel on 29 09 14 night At 03 15 a m we noticed that bath room door could not be opened To contact the reception intercom was not working I had to climb down to wake sleeping people and one boy came with a screw driver and opened the bath room door It appeared that it was a regular problem in that room and hotel management was not bothered to replace the bath room door knob In the morning when we asked for a tea and a coffee We were served with milk Boy said that he was confused When we checked out on 01 10 14 morning when we brought the poor maintenance to the notice of Manager Mr Ambrose he gave arrogant reply and he was not feeling sorry He was not bothered when I said that I have to give a bad review After charging rent of Rs 1800 if this is the treatment to guest who will prefer to recommend this hotel to fellow travellers ALL ARE REQUESTED TO BOYCOT THIS HOTEL FOR STAY Venkatasubramanian Hyderabad%%#%%stay was very good only thing was it was away from temple quality of food was good not very expensive only thing no south indian tiffen items at night but service staff room service and cleanliness are very good %%#%%

20.330143,96.52182,4,the resort is just perfect to relax and to recharge your batteries if needed very clean rooms and nice atmosphere but the biggest plus is the staff extremely nice and helpful always with a smile that appeared to be genuine only downside bar closed at 11pm but so did all the other restaurants in the surrounding as well as a conclusion Id always recommend this place to my friends you can t do anything wrong booking there ps thanks for making my last days in myanmar as relaxed and enjoyable as the whole trip in this lovely country %%#%%Both my wife and I stayed at Amata Resort and Spa at the end of a 12 day escorted tour of Myanmar and we certainly managed to keep The best wine till last There are many happy memory s we will take away from our 6 night stay here Oct 13th 19th 2014 but the one that stands out most for us was the interaction we had with the management and staff and the very pleasant relationship they had with each other On arrival the check in at reception was quick and easy even though we arrived with other guests with different nationalities the reception staff handled it with ease Any time my wife or I used reception we were met with a friendly smile and the traditional min ga la ba We were very happy with the accommodation which was spacious with tea coffee making facilities clean bathroom area and excellent air conditioning The room service was completed nice and early without been intrusive and the same can be said for the turndown service at night The breakfast was more than satisfactory and probably the reason that we did not require lunch We had dinner in the restaurant on a number of occasions and were very pleased with quality quantity and the service was excellent It could do with better lighting as it was difficult to read the menu at times The price including drinks was very competitive for a 4 star resort We certainly plan to return here and would highly recommend this resort for your visit to Ngapali Beach Eamonn And Collette Doyle Dublin Ireland%%#%%We are returning for a 3rd time to Myanmar and will be spending our last 5 nights in Amata as we have done for last 2 years because we always have an amazing time The location is perfect and the staff are all wonderful The best hotel on the beach for sure %%#%%After a full on fortnight touring Burma this was just the break we needed Superb location fabulous food and great staff we just had the best 5 days imaginable and cant wait to go back Rooms were beautifully airy and the location for breakfast almost on the beach by the pool just fantastic %%#%%I couldnt get into the Sandoway which definitely has a charm of its own and so I stayed at the Amata next door I was in a deluxe upstairs room and it was lovely Spacious bright quiet I seem some other comments about air con being inefficient but I prefer a fan at night anyway and so I didn t feel it was inadequate The food was fine nothing special although breakfast was good However there are plenty of local seafood restaurants up and down the main strip to choose from The beach was lovely and long at one end you reach the local fishing village It is lovely to see the boats going out at night and returning in the early morning when whole families are involved in the catch hauling and drying and cleaning etc Certainly a resort to consider if you are going to Ngapali %%#%%
20.330143,96.52182,3,Compared to other countries in Asia hotels in Myanmar are over rated in price and class stars With that in mind this I would say that this is one of the better hotels in Myanmar for its price value Clean rooms and nicely maintained gardens The electricity network was weak we had four power break downs during our one day stay %%#%%Based on some of the reviews I was a little concerned however I found my room to be a nice clean quiet place to spend the night The breakfast was good but I went across the street for dinner so cannot comment on the food But some simple colorful bed coverings would go a long way in an inexpensive manner to make these rooms feel less like dorm rooms and provide more warmth and comfort %%#%%I stayed just one night in the resort on my way to Bagan Clean place but but lagging the charm it could have given it is the only place Westerners could consider in town The atmosphere in the restaurant is like being in a tuckers tavern in Mongolia %%#%%The hotel looks very nice but that is completely undone by lack of service decent facilities The new rooms are nice enough but staff cant speak English are unable to provide tourism services i e they didnt have a map or couldn t explain the sites to me and I struggled to get their help to find me a taxi restaurant was pretty average pool wasn t very clean This hotel will be fine if you are passing through and have your own car or organised tour %%#%%Fine for a one night stop but I would have been disappointed to stay longer Building work was ongoing during our stay which we had to pass by to get to the entrance and reception Likewise the lake was screened off so we didnt get the lovely views that we had anticipated Mossie spray definitely needed Enough with the negatives and moving to the positives the chalet style rooms were spacious and comfortable if a little dated the restaurant offered quick service and excellent food at reasonable prices and the staff were friendly and keen to help Hopefully the wider aesthetics are now sorted as this is the only reason I have offered an average score %%#%%
20.330143,96.52182,4,We fully agree with others when they say the Hotel Manager Wah Wah was so lovely and could not do enough to make sure you were being looked after The friendly staff always had a smile for you as well The restaurant food was delicious as well as the French and Myanmar wines The room service was excellent and we really felt at home and made feel very special Will always have fond memories of our stay at this hotel Thank you Wah Wah and Staff for making our holiday in Bagan so enjoyable %%#%%I agree with other review stating the hotel manager is lovely and always smiling and cant do enough to make sure you have a great stay She organised a electric scooter for us and all our bus tickets The rooms are really nice and the beds huge and comfortable Breakfasts were great and the service from staff very attentive The large verandah also nice to sit out on looking out to the well maintained gardens and chat in the evenings It is fairly close to the start of the temples but quite a distance from Nyaung U and our poor electric scooter ran out of power there and we had to get a taxi back %%#%%If theres a more personable hotel manager in Asia than the lovely Wah Wah then I would be surprised She looks after her guests with a warm kindness that makes you feel like family and for her staff nothing is too much trouble The rooms are good it doesn t have a swimming pool but there is one nearby that guests can use I would strongly recommend it %%#%%We stayed there over a weekend and didnt have a single thing that we can really call a bad experience Here s a breakdown of our stay Pros Very friendly staff always eager to help out and always smiling It s right on the edge of where the pagodas and temples start and is about a 15 minute electric bike ride to old Bagan Food quantity served is very good for the price you pay Very easy to arrange an e bike or a taxi through the reception About 15 minute drive to the airport Cons The room we stayed in was a bit dark during the daytime but again it s not a deal breaker If we go back to Bagan which we probably will we will stay here again %%#%%I stayed here in December 2013 for two nights The guest houses were very beautiful with traditional woven bamboo walls The grounds were even more beautiful impeccably landscaped with hanging Bougainville on trellis The staff was very friendly it is run by an older woman and her nephew I think an industrious young Burmese man who studied business in the U S They rent bicycles both standard and electric which are a perfect way to tour the temples They also made a couple phone calls for me and got me on an afternoon bus to Mandalay as opposed to the night bus which most westerners take which was lovely because I got great views of the countryside but saved a lot of time compared to taking the train There is a temple on the same block as the guesthouse so you will hear the droning sound of Buddhist chanting over a loud speaker late into the evening but I thought this was a charming and authentic addition to my stay and inside the room it is not loud enough to keep you awake Overall a lovely stay I would recommend to anyone %%#%%
20.330143,96.52182,4,We stayed 2 days 3 nights in a Deluxe room with sea view 1 Pros Excellent location with stunning views desert sand beach with coconut trees a real postcard picture Beautiful and clean swimming pool Room super clean bed really comfortable Good and complete breakfast Good massages at the spa 2 Cons the main problem is that they pretend to be a 5 star hotel but the service is definitely not aligned with such standards Many standard services for this standing are not provided bad wifi compared to other places in Myanmar additional fee for using the tennis court 10 or to make a local phone call 1 3mn bike location really expensive 1 hour and they were the worst bikes we rented in Myanmar massages at spa that costed more than what was announced on the flyer in the room reception etc another issue was that we booked directly with them and their prices were more expensive than on Booking or Agoda We had to argue for a day to have the same prices as on the websites and they wouldnt conceal the slightest reduction then considered that we were in low season and there was no one in the hotel We weren t able to speak to the manager who apparently wasn t there during our whole stay another negative point when you pretend to be a 5 star hotel This is not shopkeeper at all and even if the place was wonderful I don t think I ll come back because of this incident that really made me look like a greedy western girl although what I asked was normal why should I pay more than others for the same room If you d like to go there I strongly recommend you to book them with Booking or Agoda %%#%%We stayed one week in this resort The room was fabulous Two beds one king size one small minibar wooden floor plenty of space beautiful bathroom Soap toothpaste water do not drink from the tap included Large terrace with two big loungers The resort is gorgeous just in front of the amazing beach of Ngwe Saung There is nice swimming pool a restaurant internet room and large main hall with couches where guests can seat comfortably Internet is poor so if you are planning to work in front of the awesome beach its a no no It s a place where you come to relax Breakfast is rich with multiple choices from rice to continental food Cheese juices break jam Omelette cooked in front of you eggs Nice tables etc Food in the restaurant is ok There is not so much to do in Ngwe Saung so you will probably end up either having lunches in the hotel or visiting hotel restaurant nearby The staff is nice kind and you see they are really trying to do their best but they still require adequate training but I do understand they are making a big effort and I really appreciate it On the beach guests can lay on the sunbeds covered by a leaf roof you can buy the local coconut and sip it on the beach swim walk around take a nap rent a motorbike ride a horse and jump on a oxcart for a short trip I will recommend you to walk around try restaurants and rent motorbike to drive through the whole beach There are few little islands to visit but we did not go Would I stay again YES Remember it will take you 6 hours by bus from Yangon Bus is very comfortable and air conditioned You can also take a taxi but it is way more expensive Bring cash with you as there is no ATM there is one ATM car driving around but I do not think you can find it every day For any other tip or query feel free to ask %%#%%We had our family holiday with my 80 years old Dad and 16 months old nephew suitable for both of them and they were so happy We had 1 Royal Bengal villa no 116 and 1 Deluxe garden view room no 413 for 5 adults and one child both rooms were nicely decorated and comfortable Resort is definitely better than the photos on the website greener If you have a third person staying on the day bed of Royal Bengal Villa you might want to ask for mosquito net and the air con is not so cold My 16 months old nephew couldn t sleep and had to move to our garden view room in the middle of the night lucky there is an extra bed Foreigners are being charged 30 USD more than locals for accommodation You can use either USD or Myanmar Kyat conversion rate 1 000 Kyat 1 USD as of April 2014 We had most of our meals from the restaurant love their fried noodle and room service is very fast Expensive compared to the food you can order from outside local but it is reasonable for international standard They serve 7 point out of 10 breakfast 24 hr electricity and only a few hours cut off air con is a plus point compare to other resorts They have buggies bring you around in the resort and even provided a wheel chair so convenient for my handicapped Dad Love the glass roof at the bathroom Never used so called bath tub in the villa Life Jackets and tubes are provided FOC There is lifeguard from hotel watching us whenever we go down to the water so we felt safe Warning one fine noon we went down into the sea for a dip and found a lot of blue coin sized jelly alike things on the beach but we didn t realize till I got itchiness pain on my shoulder and found that thing Soon realized from a lifeguard that it is Blue button jelly fish in Myanmar Yay khu No harm but it irritate your skin for the whole day and I still have some marks on my body after two weeks Cure rub with lime you will feel a bit more comfortable Would be better if lifeguard had warned us in advance %%#%%This hotel has an identity problem It is not sure whether to concentrate on its many local guests from Yangon or to try and encourage more higher value international guests The big tour operators invariably choose Ngapali to end their guests tour of Myanmar Maybe it is because Ngwe Saung is not up to standard or maybe it is the 5 hour drive that puts people off Bay of Bengal Resort boasts that it is a 5 resort but in fact I would suggest it is just about a 4 We once again had a Royal Bengal Beachfront Suite very spacious and ideally situated It had had a recent lick of paint to make it smart and it was very clean however The resort is not really geared up for long stay more than 5 days international travellers We had 3 coat hangers but ordered another 10 from housekeeping there is very little space to store clothes that dont hang up so you are living out of your suitcase The vast majority of guests were from Myanmar either long weekend or on a company incentive sales trip The pool was disappointingly cloudy all the time This is not because it is not cleaned properly it is because most local guests insist of being dressed in tee shirts and other outer clothing when swimming and the filters get clogged with particles of fabric One particular morning following a party the previous night the pool had a lot of litter including green coconut shells when having finished the milk the shell was discarded in the pool some guests were also seen to clean sand off their feet in the pool after returning from the beach It is just a question of knowing what is acceptable in a resort The beach is not dirty but it is not raked and cleaned as it is next door at the Aureum Palace There are a number of local ponies that are based near BoB but sadly their droppings are not cleaned up by the owners of the ponies I live near Weston Super Mare Somerset UK where we have donkeys on the beach for the children to ride The owners are obliged to clean up after the donkeys The same should happen in Ngwe Saung If the horses are brought onto a private hotel beach then the pony owners should be made clean up after them The location of the hotel is ideal the beach goes on for many miles and it is a 20 minute stroll to the town where there are shops and restaurants although we ate in the hotel The Fisherman s Bar is good for lunch and the main restaurant is good for dinner The breakfast is OK better than our last visit The gardens around reception and public areas are well kept but there is still too much dead grass and many dead plants near the rooms The garden staff insist on watering bare patches of ground in the hope that something may grow if they do it enough I hope that Bay of Bengal continues to improve There is little sign of any of the management team and I firmly believe that if the owners want to move this hotel into the 5 league then they must employ a European General Manager to raise the standards %%#%%Hospitality and well

20.330143,96.52182,4,We stayed two nights as part of a trip around Myanmar The hotel is very nice rooms are tastefully furnished and has a strong eco theme The staff are friendly perhaps a little overstaffed as they were overly attentive at times The location is very tranquil which given the noisy engines on the boats seemed a real plus compared to some of the other resorts However as others have mentioned this does limit evening options We did wander out with our kids to a local bar outside the resort and were warmly received So do explore if this is a concern A few small gripes which given the price I feel are justified First they dont take credit cards Whilst this is normal in Myanmar it was not for a hotel of this price and actually meant I avoided using the spa as I was worried about cash there being only 1 atm in the area Second the rooms are nice but awkwardly arranged for families They won t put more than 3 in a room even if they are kids with parents and the way the entrances are arranged we did not feel comfortable putting them alone in a room so we had to split 1 parent and 1 kid to a room I don t see why they won t put 2 fold out beds in the bigger rooms Finally if you are going to boast eco credentials then don t put nuts shipped from California in the room and serve more local cuisine in the restaurant %%#%%It is strange how people can have such different views of the same hotel We loved this hotel it was so peaceful and the view from our large balcony were breathtaking We had room 108 on first floor We chose not to stay on the lake itself Maybe the WiFi signal and TV were poor but we didnt come to Inle lake for that We ate in the hotel for breakfast and dinner both days of our stay which is really unusual for us but we knew that the hotel was isolated when we booked it Breakfast was fruit juice museli pastries toast and choice of eggs omelette How anyone can complain about that I don t know Dinner was a set meal Asian the first night and French the second It was nouvelle cuisine 4 or 5 courses followed by coffee or tea and home made cookies All were beautifully presented and garnished When I refused the soup I was offered another type Everything was grown in their gardens and breads and cakes cooked in hotel service was impeccable Staff were friendly and helpful Facilities in the room were not as fancy or high tech as some of the hotel s we have stayed in but everything worked Our previous hotel in Mandalay was twice the price and more upmarket but not as nice as the lake view hotel %%#%%Arrival 4am in the morning and will not let us into our room where our was available make us rest in the lobby When we ask for a late check out we was not allowed for late check out No shuttle service to the town no restaurant around the area hence had to eat in their restaurant Breakfast were terrible and the restaurant meals are expensive Wifi was down on the day we was there Not much a view unless you stay on the upper floor and facing the lake Very quite location If possible book your accommodation in the town areas where there is more lovely there unless all you want is to eat and sleep %%#%%This is a lovely hotel in a lovely place Inle Lake is very special Inle lake View Resort is a superbly peaceful hotel in a gorgeous area All the staff are just terrific English is spoken very very well there The rooms are very good and very well appointed The restaurant and its staff are genuinely first class There is a serious eco feel to the place without being over the top The only minus is the technology the internet is severely limited and the TV only has Burmese speaking channels This may be because of the national infrastructure limitations BUT don t let that put you off going there We stayed in some of the very best places in Burma and this property is right up there with the very best %%#%%The location of this hotel is great with fantastic views to the lake However even though we were given a WiFi password it absolutely did not work Our room was great with a balcony overlooking the lake The only problem was the food Now I can see from some other reviews that some people think it is OK We did not It is extremely expensive for what it was and of course one is stuck there for the evening as no boats are allowed on the lake at night Second night we only had starters During the day we had excellent food at two other restaurants on the lake so it is possible to have good local food in the area %%#%%
20.330143,96.52182,3,The hotel is beautiful and the staff was very accommodating No complaints at all with the room or restaurant Plus wifi was a plus for being out in the middle of no where Why only 3 stars Because when we booked the staff never warned about the 45 minute walk to the hotel from Golden Rock This was no easy walk either I never would have chosen this place had I known about the walk The travel agent in Myanmar I used conveniently left out the walk There are ways around the walk Hire a booking agency that can give you very specific details on where to get off the truck and how to plan your day up on the mountain Dont think like I did it that it is all self explanatory %%#%%the hotel has great views to all the mountains around and the valley the rooms have towels and blankets and they give you a tooth brush and a shampoo sample so if you are on a tour and they tell you to pack just to overnight there take it into account the food at the restaurant is very improvable and the special dishes mainly containing fish were actually the worst ones try to avoid ordering them %%#%%September month which lots of people said its raining season and not advisable to visit this place We ignore and still went there Straight touch down Yangon we departed with bus to Golden Rock base camp Please make sure you buy the bus ticket from Yangon straight to golden rock base camp We bought wrongly and end up at a town near the base camp A young lady who speak little English will approach you and asked where you are going She will arranged a pick up truck took you to Bawga hotel at base camp We stay twin room with air condition shared bathroom for USD20 each I believe there are more cheaper than this Anyway the service and internet was good 7 30am you can join the pick up just in front the hotel up to hill for 2 500 kyats 1 way The ride was amazing with S road and you will hear shouting from the foreigners but not locals Entrance fee for Golden Rock is 6 000 kyats You can visit as long as you can we stayed there for a bit local food and photos taking You can buy gold leaves and make a wish with the Golden Rock Please wear proper attire as part of the respect Ladies only can take photo from outside not allowed to go in near the rock There s beauty with raining lots of fogging and nice cooling weather Lots of workers carrying sand and bricks for renovation Remember the young lady dont listen to what her recommendation for your next destination We felt cheated when we bought bus ticket from Bago to Bagan It was 18 000 kyats each for overnight bus however she didnt mentioned and explained we cant take the bus straight from Bago We need to pay extra 7 000 kyats for a tuk tuk to take us to a half way of the express way for the bus Be careful and asked if not extra cost will be there %%#%%We stayed here as part of a tour for one night The location is between the Golden a Rock and the last stopping point for the large trucks that ferry passengers the 45 minute journey to the rock From the rock its about 25 minutes downhill walk so not good for anyone with walking difficulties The hotel itself was clean and fine for a quick overnight stop There is a separate shower area in the bathroom Wifi is free and available in the lobby area Breakfast is limited eggs bread and fruit but enough for what you need There aren t many hotels in the area so this is a good choice Hopefully that is helpful anymore questions just ask %%#%%We stayed at this hotel for one night A bit expensive but the room was large and clean The bed allright The staff was very nice and helpful The food was average at best It is quite a ride to get there with the open back truck and a good walk All in all great location Ok room poor food %%#%%

19.674307,96.12524,4,We spent 4 nights with a small child in the Emerald in October It s a typical hotel in the Naypyitaw hotel strip a place a bit like Dubai with many large hotels of vastly different styles making up the strip not necessary a pretty sight but adding greatly to the surreal nature of the capital The Emerald is a mid size hotel with only one main building with a restaurant as only real service element and some auxiliary buildings with rooms and suites Guests are being driving around in golf carts though that s not necessary it s hardly more than 100 m to the furthest room The rooms are nice though also generic The restaurant is very good nicely designed and good menu The chef Jonny is Italian and was very friendly and helpful Food was very good and other staff were uniformly charming and helpful which we greatly appreciated Breakfast is also nice One problem is that the hotel remains unfinished The pool and spa remain under construction hence other than going to the restaurant there is nothing to do The hotel is also the last one on the strip hence furthest from whatever center the capital has Public transport doesn t exist taxis are scarce and can t simply be ordered to the hotel The Emerald offers transport as well though at 20 US for a drive to the Junction shopping center 15 minutes away or 80 US to the zoo including a couple of hours waiting are hardly attractive In the end it pays to walk to the street and try to flag down transport a taxi ride to the shopping area then costs more like 7 8 US Overall a good place with very friendly and helpful staff but unfinished and in serious need to get spa and pool working and quite isolated %%#%%Emerald Palace Hotel is modern nice and friendly with nice gardens The rooms are spacious even the standard deluxe room The restaurant in the main building near reception is nice with a very good menu plenty of variety and they have a great Chef Italian who provided us with something special that wasnt on the menu The management and staff very nice polite and helpful The hotel is in a quiet location with easy access to all services shopping malls and airport I was very pleased with my stay there and shall use this hotel again %%#%%In the slightly bizarre capital city of Myanmar I suppose I should not be surprised to find a top class boutique hotel with beautiful rooms I stayed in a Grand Villa well trained staff that anticipate your every need and cuisine to die for This is my second stay at the EPH and I was welcomed back like the prodigal son even though it is a year since I was last there The main building has a comfortable reception area and a restaurant that serves cordon bleu dishes Upstairs there is an area for seminars and corporate functions Rooms and villas are spread out over an acre or so It is generally warm so the walk from your room to reception though short can be a little sticky but there are staff with golf carts available if you want to escape the heat quickly My villa was huge A simply but tastefully decorated living room with hardwood floors throughout kitchenette including microwave fridge a large TV DVR etc a dining table a desk for working and 42 Mbit s up and down internet speed over Wi Fi The bedroom also has hardwood floors an extremely comfortable king size bed another TV decent free movie channels and plenty of room for clothes The bathroom is enormous with a great shower cubicle and good hot water pressure Outside there is a patio accessible from the living room or bedroom Although Nay Pyi Taw is bereft of taxis cars can be arranged with the hotel at very reasonable rates to get around the city The highlight of my stay was Chef Giovannis strip loin which was divine I have no hesitation in recommending EPH It was more than home from home it was better than home %%#%%Reading the review about rats before I arrived on a business trip got me slightly concerned but during my stay I had a room on the ground floor and didnt encounter anything like that The rooms are perfectly satisfactory and what you d expect in a similar up country location say in Thailand or elsewhere in South East Asia Staff were super helpful and friendly yes sometimes communication was a bit difficult with the less skilled english speakers but what do you expect Its not like Naypidaw has been around for years and is a well trodden path for international tourism The details that I mentioned that let them down were things like On the second day the towels had been replaced in the bathroom but one of the replacements smelt like it had been stored damp and gave off an unpleasant smell The new speaker for ambient music in the corridor was turned up a bit too loud as even with the tv on and me being farthest from the corridor the music was still audible The wardrobe in the room for hanging clothes was large but not great for actually hanging clothes as when I hung a suit up the space between the clothes rail and the shelf in the wardrobe was too small and so the suit hung kinda crumpled in the wardrobe Breakfast varied from extremely bland congee to extremely salty bacon Overall the dining experience in the hotel was a majority good tasting and good value given the lack of competition in Napiydaw for the business international crowd I think that s an extremely important selling point for the Emerald Palace Hotel Lastly must mention the good the wifi provided free of charge byt he hotel I never had a problem during the duration of my stay and hearing the grumbles about wifi from other conference attendees it appears this might be a unique selling point too %%#%%This is an average hotel although looks good on the exterior Rooms can be very unclean with rats roaming inside the room And be rest assured nobody can help you since language is a very bog problem there So even if a rat bothers you at night nobody helps So befriend it The staff although is alright and checks out the room even for a small laundry bag Food is good But service is extremely distressingly slow Nay Pi Taw is full of good hotels select this property when nothing else is left %%#%%

there during festive season We all decided to visit the fort one day and I was amazed with it For locals this is Nagaur ka Fort or Fort of Nagaur Its main entrance of the fort is right in the main market of Nagaur Very nominal entrance fee 30 INR per person and 50 INR for camera You get receipt for everything Your entry fees also cover for guide We met the guide and he took us to many places in the fort and explained in detail There were also few rooms which were closed you can only see them if you have guide around He opened those rooms and showed us beautiful paintings on wall and ceilings which are very well preserved According to our guide students from UK come regularly to clean and repaint the paintings Which is awesome We finished the tour of fort in couple of hours by the time we were finishing it was sunset We also visited lord Ganesh temple which is within fort vicinity This place definitely needs more visibility for tourists couldn t see anything related to this fort online %%#%%Nagaur Fort Having been to a wedding in rural Rajasthan and heading for Bikaner we wanted somewhere to stop off on the way Looking at maps I came across Nagaur and its fort I found it quite hard to gather information about the fort on line before travelling there so I was very pleased to have a guide as part of the entrance fee Known locally as Ahhichatragarh The Fort of the Hooded Cobra the fort is enormous As we entered town we could see the high bastion walls all along the side of the road but no obvious signs of the entrance Our driver had driven through the town on several occasions but never actually been inside the fort I am really glad we made the effort We were the only visitors there and were treated very well The guide spoke very good English and was enthusiastic about the things he was showing us I was particularly taken with the large wooden elephant in the entrance to the palaces which was once used by the royal children during processions It would have been magnificent at the time all beautifully painted and with water coming out of its trunk The palace was built between the 12th and the 19th century and some of the interiors are mind blowing An ongoing restoration project recognised by UNESCO in an award means some rooms and palaces are in better condition than others The fort was one of the first Muslim strongholds in northern India built in the early 1100s over the mound of of a fourth century mud fort It was repeatedly altered over subsequent centuries most of the surviving structures in the central complex date from the 17th and 18th centuries Of special mention is the Hadi Rani Mahal named after a well known local queen and was the dwelling place of the wives of the rulers of Nagaur Lattice screens were installed on the windows of the upper floors so that the women could see out without being seen In the enormous central courtyard you will find the swimming pools they were dry when we visited but I understand they get filled in the wet season There was a ladies pool childrens pool and the King s pool Some festivals are held inside the fort complex what a wonderful setting The Maharaja had 16 wives and built a balcony for each one of them overlooking his throne room Another very interesting part of the fort was the cooling towers The wind tower is essentially a tall capped chimney with one face open at the top This open side faces the prevailing wind thus catching it and brings it down the tower into the heart of the building to maintain air flow thus cooling the building interior It does not necessarily cool the air itself but rather relies on the rate of airflow to provide a cooling effect Ancient AC Other palaces included the Deepak Mahal with hundreds of niches for oil lamps and a mosque built by Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal nothing like the same scale as the Taj but interesting all the same The guide was very caring and kind and when I didn t feel well he allowed the driver to come all the way up into the palace to collect me going off to find the key for opening the gate We thoroughly enjoyed the fort and were very impressed with the murals and interior decorations and thought it was a very worthwhile to stop here %%#%%Since we were travelling to stay with our tour operator Ganpat Prajapats village home we passed via Nagaur off the beaten track and were told to visit Nagaur Fort which Ganpat said is also known as Ahhichatragarh fort didnt know it is also called Fort of the Hooded Cobra see review by unexploreindia This place is deserted and we were told conservation work is on going by the Mehrangarh Museum Trust Jodhpur The sentry took us to a guide to show us around He did a good job by starting with a video presentation of the changes being made by the Trust which is getting foreign US aid He showed us a lot of places and rooms and explained the details which was impressive It has unique water systems including storage and baths Dont forget to see how water was taken out of a well in the corner of the vast fort area and transferred to the palace in the fort via overhead aqua ducts Emperor Akbar stayed here for some time and a building is named after him Akbari Mahal Note also that this place was inhabited by the Border Security Forces BSF as it is relatively close to the Indo Pak border and also note the damage and graffiti done by the soldiers Even though the fort is deserted when we went it was alive for us with the detailed explanation by the guide The guide also told us that some artifacts have been temporarily removed to Jopdhpur and will be returned when the conservation work is completed %%#%%Ahhichatragarh or Fort of the Hooded Cobra is the second name of this fort Situated in the market it was one of the first Muslim strongholds in
