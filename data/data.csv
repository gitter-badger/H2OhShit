251713,41.352196,-70.51572,4,My friends and I have been trying to plan a girls weekend for years I chose this property because it was on the water and looked very attractive We shared a one bedroom suite that had ample room for the four of us There was a full kitchen with all the necessary supplies There was a lot of charm to the grounds including an Alice in Wonderland life sized chess set The one criticism I had is that the dining room staff was preparing for a luncheon at the same time they were serving breakfast and they were flustered and disorganized This would not keep me from enjoying another stay here %%#%%My wife and I travel a fair amount usually 3 4 trips annually with family and just the two of us I do my homework so as not to get burned This is a family resort We have 11 grandchildren so were comfortable in this kind of environment 1 Staff Beyond excellent friendly competent attentive From the reservation lady who worked hard to get our reservations handled to the gentleman who took us to the boat dock and explained how you fish for scallops 2 Site Beautiful and well maintained Spotlessly clean 3 On site amenities Here were the problems Restaurant they have an excellent restaurant but only for dinner Lunch is a limited fare at the pool and there s no breakfast seating at all There is a general store with limited choices but nowhere to sit Oceanside the resort is about 1 2 mile from the beach You walk a path through the bush over a bridge and then cross a road to get to the sand Two pools Yep but one is about 1 2 mile away from the main hotel at their townhouse section 4 Location this is not a Winnitu issue Shame on me I thought we could do without a car and maybe you can if you re staying in town This resort is at the end of the island and a distance from just about everything They provide very frequent shuttles to Edgartown But if you want to go other places you need a car Why not for boomer couple it s at least not for this boomer couple The lack of dining facilities was a big downer as was the trek to the beach I guess because there s cooking facilties in most units the thinking is there s little need for a real breakfast or lunch place Am I being picky I don t think so It was expensive highly rated and I had high expectations %%#%%My husband and I stayed at the Winnetu for a few days after Columbus Day weekend which is our favorite time to travel to New England the Cape and now Marthas Vineyard because most of the tourists are leaving or in the process of doing so We picked the resort because of the close proximity to Edgartown and South Beach and all of it was a very pleasant surprise We arrived on the Vineyard Monday morning did a little exploring and were able to get into our room West Chop Suite on 3rd floor earlier than expected The suite was lovely and the best part was that we could hear the ocean even though it s about 250 yards from the hotel It was well appointed comfortable clean and the kitchenette was stocked with anything you might need for cooking eating in if that is what you want to do Since there were so few guests in the hotel for the next few days we felt like we had the place to ourselves The staff was so friendly accomodating willing to help with anything and to answer all our questions We spent one day exploring the island and then decided to spend most of our time walking on the beach sitting and staring at the ocean or reading I bet we didn t see 20 people on the wonderful South beach the entire stay The homes in Edgartown are amazing I could have spent the entire 4 days just wandering through town and taking pictures of all the gorgeous houses and gardens One of the problems with traveling after Columbus Day is a lot of shops and galleries are closed but it was great to be able to walk on the streets and really look at everything without fighting the summer crowds Our one big surprise about Martha s Vineyard skunks Apparently they are everywhere We saw them on the street in downtown Edgartown and a couple headed toward the pool one evening after dinner You can see their tracks on the beach so for that reason and the deer ticks we didn t wander off the path from the hotel to the beach or any other path on the island for that matter Winnetu is well set up and obviously caters to families We hope to return next October with our family which won t be as relaxing as this past trip but it will be fun Bottom line Winnetu is a great place to visit if you go when we do please don t book our favorite suite %%#%%The service was excellentThe room was very clean and gave a feeling of being at home The resort is located within walking distance of the best beach on the island its removed from the downtown area so it s peaceful and they have everything you need at the resort so if you didn t want to leave you d be all taken care of We can only say good things because the overall service cleanliness and accommodations were phenomenal %%#%%We loved our stay at the winnetu There are so many activities for children We travelled with our 16 month old son and he had a great time They have a lot of toys you can use for the pool or beach also We enjoyed the fire truck rides and the cookies in the afternoon The walk to the beach was far if you have to carry your child and the beach supplies Sometimes we just drove instead The rooms were nicely decorated and clean The staff was very friendly %%#%%
