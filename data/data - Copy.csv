103636,41.151665,-71.55683,5,My wife and I went to Mohegan Bluffs in late October and we were the only two people there It was a fantastic experience at an amazing site You really cant imagine how beautiful this place is until you see it in person We could have spent all day there Put this place on your must see list %%#%%You have to take the stairway down and back to see these awesome bluffs reaching out to the Atlantic Ocean Great vista to see the bluffs and scenery around them Totally a majestic place to be and just take in all its goodness When you go to Block Island this is a must see %%#%%We took a tour of the island that included the bluffs and really enjoyed the sights Would recommend taking a tour if you are not riding a moped around the island %%#%%It takes a bit of work to get out there but the view is breathtaking The beach and bluffs look untouched like howthey may have looked thousands of years ago Cool place to go in the water but not if you need to bring blankets coolers little children etc b c there are a million stairs %%#%%The history is that the Mohegans crossed over and attacked the local Indian tribe who pushed back and in the process pushed some of them off of these cliffs to the rocks below We went down the 164 or so steps and then back up to the beach which is rough and rock strewn Theres a rope down there to pull yourself back up Bring your trekking poles %%#%%
